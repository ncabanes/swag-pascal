Two ways to create dial tones: digital sample for each tone, or generate tone
with a digital to analog convertor. The MCI mmSystem uses MS Windows 3.1 high
resolution timer. The following demonstrate other ways to generate tones: }

program PlayTone;

uses WinProcs;

   star brackets *)
const Magic : integer=376;
      Tempo : integer = 120;
      NoteType : integer = 4;
(*
        Magic is used as a multiplier to determine the duration of a
        note.  The Windows API documentation for setVoiceSound
        indicates that duration should be a straight forward
        calculation of yea-so-many clock ticks.  It just isn't so.
        Brute force experimentation found 376.  It seems to work fine
        regardless of processor speed or whatever.  I've tested on
        386/33, 386/16, and 8088/4.7 machines -- they all work.  Let
        me tell you, it was sure fun setting up and running Windows on
        that 8088/4.7 CGA equipment.

    The actual tone production routines follow.  If you've explored
    the API music functions at all, you may wonder why I'm using
    setVoiceSound instead of setVoiceNote.  setVoiceNote seems, on the
    surface, to be the automatic way to write these sorts of things,
    but it just doesn't work very well.  Whole notes and half notes
    are incorrectly produced, dots are impossible, and the nicety of
    having legato is gone.  setVoiceSound works much better, though it
    does require that you calculate a duration rather than just
    specifying tempo and length.

Windows wants the fractional and integer portions of the frequency
stuffed respectively into the low and high words of a long integer.

setVoiceSound doesn't provide for a rest.  Instead, I've plugged an
impossibly high pitch into the [0] slot of that array.  It's
presumably playing, but you shouldn't hear it.
*)
var   Pitch : array[0..84] of LongInt;
      Herz  : array[0..11] of Real;
      Tone  : integer;              { index }

 function Duration(Tempo, NoteType : integer) : integer;
 var Temp : real;
 begin
   Temp := 60 / Tempo * Magic * 4 / NoteType;
   Duration := trunc(Temp);
 end;

BEGIN  {main}
Pitch[0] := MakeLong(0,20000);
Tone := 0;                          { example tone index }
Herz[Tone] := 523.25;               { note 'C' white frequency }
Pitch[Tone+1] := MakeLong(trunc(frac(Herz[Tone])),trunc(int(Herz[Tone])));
setVoiceSound(1,Pitch[Tone+1],Duration(Tempo,NoteType) * 7 div 8 );
                                    {1. Accept note number}
setVoiceSound(1,Pitch[0],Duration(Tempo,NoteType) * 1 div 8 );
                                    {2. Sound off, zero means silence}
                                    {3. Translate note into 'frequency'}
                                    {4. Setup timer chip}
                                    {5. Setup frequency}
                                    {6. Sound on}
                                    {7. Setup note length delays}
(*
I don't know why I've got to send one last 'empty' note to the
voice queue, but without it, the last real note doesn't get played.
That's the purpose of the next statement.
*)
setVoiceSound(1,0,1);
setVoiceThreshold(1,0);
StartSound;
repeat until GetThresholdStatus = 1;
CloseSound;

{ snippet follows }
; The following code uses both timers in an 80c31 to generate
; DTMF tones, and signalling tones such as BUSY, RING-BACK, etc.
; This file also contains the connections for a very crude 2 bit
; per tone A\D converter wich uses 4 bits of P1 and a low pass filter.
; Compensation for twist isn't included but could be handled by
; playing with the hi and low tone dac values and the summing amp
; input resistors.
;
; If this code is used in any application I only request that
