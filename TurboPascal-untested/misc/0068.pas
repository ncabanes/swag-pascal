 Yes, it's a little utility that I wrote, named GBUG...

 It can transform a binary file into one of three ASCII files:
  1) a script that is fed to DEBUG.COM (this is the default mode)
  2) a Turbo Pascal source code file (using the /P option)
  3) a GW-BASIC source code file (using the /B option)

 The output file (.SCR, .PAS, or .BAS) can then be posted onto text-
 based mediums, such as BBS conferences.  Receivers can recover the
 binary file without any special decoding utilities.

 Since GBUG doesn't embed any error-detection code, it's best to
 _always_ compress the original binary -- so that transportation
 errors can be detected during the file decompression stage.

 Here's GBUG15B.LZH, which contains GBUG version 1.5b ...
